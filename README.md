# Autodorks
A simple python script that simplifies the use of Google Dorks

## Description
This small script is based on RobotShell's [DorkScraper](https://github.com/robotshell/dorkScraper) project. I improved the code and added some features that I needed to have. 

TODO : Adding picture on the script

### What it does 
This python script allows the user to :
- Execute custom google dorks
- Execute specific google dorks already in the script (see [argument segment](https://github.com/K1ng-Ph1sh3r/Autodorks/edit/main/README.md#list-of-all-of-the-arguments))
- Return results in a given file
- Define a specific number of results wanted (for instance, returning the first 10 results of a google dorks)

### Dependancies 

This script relies only on [*Googlesearch-python*](https://pypi.org/project/googlesearch-python/), which will allow the script to execute some google searches.

### List of all of the arguments 

| Argument        | What it does                 |

## Installation
I recommend using this script in a dedicated python environment, but it is not mandatory.

### Cloning the repo 
```
git clone https://github.com/K1ng-Ph1sh3r/Autodorks.git
cd Autodorks
chmod +x autodorks.py
```
### Installing dependancies
```
pip install -r REQUIREMENTS.txt
```
TODO : Adding the requirement files

### Trying to run the script
```
python3 autodorks.py -v
```
If it returns the version, you can now use Autorks :D
